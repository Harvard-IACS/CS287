    "## EXPECTATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Solid programming experience, not necessarily in Python, is a prerequisite for this class. You must use `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow` for your homework assignments. If you are unfamiliar with both of these, you are responsible for becoming familiar with one of them outside of class time. We recommend `PyTorch`, which will be our framework of choice; when we provide sample code and helper code to get you started on homework assignments, our code will use `PyTorch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NOTEBOOKS\n",
    "Homework assignments will be conducted using Jupyter Notebooks, just like this one, and they will be distributed via Canvas. You will make use of many libraries, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Use this opportunity now to ensure that you have properly set up a programming environment. We **strongly recommend using virtual environments. We cannot stress this enough**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolating your projects inside specific environments helps you manage software dependencies, allowing you to have different versions of packages in each environment. This is way easier than having to make sure all installed packages are compatible across all your projects. This way you can recover from serious mess-ups by deleting an environment and not having to worry about how it affects your entire system.\n",
    " \n",
    "The two most popular tools for setting up environments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `conda` (a package and environment manager) \n",
    "- `pip` (a Python package manager) with `virtualenv` (a tool for creating environments)\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using `conda` package installation and environments. `conda` installs packages from the Anaconda Repository and Anaconda Cloud, whereas `pip` installs packages from PyPI. Even if you are using `conda` as your primary package installer and are inside a `conda` environment, you can still use `pip install` for those rare packages that are not included in the `conda` ecosystem. \n",
    "\n",

    "Now is a good time to install:\n",
    "- Python 3.5 or above\n",
    "- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): a deep learning framework for representing complicated ML algorithms and executing them in any platform, from a phone to a distributed system using GPUs. Developed by Facebook. \n",
    "- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org): essentially identical to TensorFlow in terms of what it allows you to do. Developed by Google.\n",
    "- [Keras](https://keras.io/): a high-level API used for fast prototyping, advanced research, and production. You may use `tf.keras` which is TensorFlow's implementation of the Keras API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BACKGROUND INFO:** TensorFlow was created in 2015, before PyTorch was developed, and it quickly became the most popular deep learning framework. However, it was a bit messy and complicated to create certain architectures, namely due to its lack of support for dynamic computational graphs. That is, one had to create static/stateful graphs to represent the flow of data. It had a fairly steep learning curve, yet was arguably the best package available at the time (there were many alternatives like Theano, Caffe, Torch (for Lua, C, C++), Deeplearning4j, etc). Quickly thereafter, PyTorch was released, and it offered improvements in this area. PyTorch quickly became the most popular deep learning framework for _research_ code, as one needs to quickly prototype models and get experimental results. TensorFlow was still popular, too, especially in commercial applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, TensorFlow 2.0 was released, which leveled the playing field. That is, TensorFlow and PyTorch became effectively equal to each other in terms of ease-of-use with its abstract representations. Yet, presently, the trend is continuing, whereby for _research_ and _academic_ code, PyTorch is preferred slightly more often. TensorFlow is still great for such, and it's preferred slightly more often for _commercial_ applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a [historical comparison of deep learning frameworks here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_deep-learning_software). \n",
    "\n",
    "[Installation instructions for PyTorch are here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your local machine has a GPU: (1) you are very fortunate; (2) you should install the GPU version of PyTorch or TensorFlow (e.g., w/ CUDA drivers)."
